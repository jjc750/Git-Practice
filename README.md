The article discusses "**Alexa Blueprints**", Amazon's new tool which allows Alexa owners to develop skills for the Alexa platform without knowing how to code. Today, they announced that these skills may be published directly to the U.S. Skills Store. This is interesting because it may introduce a new wave of people who have never formerly coded to be developing software and publishing it on an app store. More people will be able to access this skill development since there are many Alexa owners who have never coded before, who may be interested in creating custom skills to help with their everyday lives. It's going to be interesting to see what hapepns now that Amazon is making skill development more accessible to people.

However, this new accessibility may lead to **negative consequences**.
 
> "it could also fill the store with lower-quality apps, as templated apps aren’t unique in their design, have simple flows and don’t use voice talent or sound effects as part of their experience."
 
> "Because of their ease-of-use, these skills could be co-opted by extremists or conspiracy theorists who don’t have an official path to broadcast their “fake news” otherwise. Amazon will need to be careful in its vetting and approval process."

It is going to be interesting to see how popular Blueprints becomes, and how much moderation is done on the platform to prevent fraudulent/misleading programs from taking over the store.
